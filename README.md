Laboratory 1: Function and Recursion

Overview

This project contains solutions to a set of recursive programming problems using Java. The tasks focus on functions, recursion, and fundamental algorithmic concepts such as searching, sorting, and mathematical computations.

Problems

Problem 1: Find Minimum in an Array

Description: Given an integer n and n elements, write a function to find the minimum element.

Problem 2: Find Average of an Array

Description: Given an integer n and n elements, write a function to compute the average.

Problem 3: Check for Prime Number

Description: Given an integer n, implement a recursive function to determine whether n is prime.

Problem 4: Compute Factorial

Description: Given an integer n, implement a recursive function to compute n!.

Problem 5: Compute n-th Fibonacci Number

Description: Given an integer n, implement a recursive function to find the n-th Fibonacci number.

Problem 6: Compute Power (a^n)

Description: Given two integers a and n, implement a recursive function to compute a^n.

Problem 7: Reverse Array (Without Using Array Data Structure)

Description: Given an integer n and n elements, write a recursive function to reverse the elements without using an array data structure.

Problem 8: Check If String Contains Only Digits

Description: Given a string s, implement a function to check if it consists only of digits.

Problem 9: Compute Binomial Coefficient (C(n, k))

Description: Given n and k, implement a recursive function to compute the binomial coefficient using the formula:

where .

Problem 10: Compute GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

Description: Given two integers a and b, implement a recursive function to compute their GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm.
